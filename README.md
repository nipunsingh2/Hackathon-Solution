This is my and my teammate's work on the hackathon- Code Off Duty held on 08-03-2024 in Lovely Professional University. 
Luckily i got this chance to attend the event and perform into it. 
I chose the topic - Ideas that showcase the rich cultural heritage and traditions of India. 
We were suppsoed to make a webpage using our creativity and innovative ideas about the topic.
The problem statement code is - 25 
Though, unfortunately because of sudden fall in my teammate's health we had to quit the event and head back to out dormes.
If we were to have much time and health in our hands, we'd perform much better.
